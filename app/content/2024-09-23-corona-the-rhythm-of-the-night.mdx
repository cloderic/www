This is a cover of ["The Rhythm of the Night"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rhythm_of_the_Night) by ["Corona"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona_(band)), originally released as their debut single in 1993.

I was 9 years old when this song came out. Back then, eurodance was everywhere, but not on our home hi-fi — my parents were quite successful in shaping our musical tastes, from Blind Willie Johnson to Bach.
As a result, eurodance, and to a lesser extent, the later boy bands, have always felt like a guilty pleasure from my childhood.

A few years ago, I had already done an acoustic cover of “The Rhythm of the Night” with “Cartel,” performing it at the “Fête de la Musique” in Colombes. This version, though, is definitely funkier
and turned into a fun, late-summer project!
